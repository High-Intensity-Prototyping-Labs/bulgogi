bulgogi's core is to be written in C. This includes the inference engine and rule validation.

On top of this, projects are configured in Python. Running on top of the engine, you get stuff like:

```py 
# build.py 
import bulgogi as bul 

bul.new_project('My Project')
bul.set_version('v1.0.0)
bul.set_author('Colby Simpson')

bul.build_all()
```

There's something about this that seems so fucking sick.

It feels like I'm writing CMake...only not. It's everything bulgogi is supposed to be.

The community doors swing wide open as well by including Python. Treating Python as a scripting language and doing the analysis in the underbelly.

I've never done this before nor thought of doing this in this way. But I know I need to do it.
