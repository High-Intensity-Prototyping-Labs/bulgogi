- There should be a command `bul module rm --all`

- There needs to be a way to add target-dependencies to other targets 
        - Probably with a `bul target add target1 default`

- It would be frustrating to _only_ want to generate the dirs of 1 module 
        - But the --create flag passes over the entire project.yaml 
        - Maybe generate could accept an optional module list 
        - Otherwise it does all by default
