- There is nothing that the Python API can do that the engine cannot do.
- Python serves as a scripting interface for the engine, both in terms of configuring and building projects.
- The setup.py script:
        - Produces project.yaml and all .bul/** files localizing sources and headers.
        - Checks for any dependencies needed.
        - Applies patches/etc.
- The build.py script:
        - Calls the build engine to build the project.
        - Checks for any changes/updates to the underlying structure.

** Again, all of these operations are done _through_ the engine. There may be a CLI one day, but for now this will be a Python API.
