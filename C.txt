Inferencing Engine:
        -> Target Hash ( name, type ) = Unique ID
                -> No more using strings as the identifier.
                -> Instead a target's name and its type will generate a unique ID.
                -> Everything will be worked in terms of those IDs.
        -> Target Usage ( Project, Hash ) = Atom, Lib, Exe, Ambiguous.
                -> Result of analyzing a project to obtain a target's usage.
                -> Powered by inference, the worst case is ambiguity.
                -> 

Other Notes:
        -> Everything is a target.
        -> There is no longer a distinction between Module/Library/Executable.

Target Configuration:
        -> This is what I am aiming for for bulgogi's self-build:

        bulgogi:
        - cmake
        - client*
        - project

        cmake:
        - project

        -> Notice that the name cmake is re-used. This should be an integral feature.
