Bulgogi Laws:

1. Modules are never polymorphic.
        An executable module in one target is not another's library.
        Once an executable module, always an executable module.
        
2. All targets are representations.
        An executable can be a combination of modules and target libraries.
        If a standalone library is desired, it must be a module.
        All target libraries are virtual in bulgogi (CMake calls them interfaces).
