- When CMakeTargets are created From<Target>, they cannot prevent duplicate modules
	from being declared within the CMakeProject. This either needs to be a formal 
	feature or have the approach work top-to-bottom with direct conversion from 
	bulgogi Project to CMakeProject as originally intended.
- The executable indicator (*) appears in the module name internally.
- There is possibly a problem with the lack of FS checks when loading a project
	-> (e.g.: a bunch of modules are listed in the project.yaml which do not exist in the FS.)
- Trying to add the same module as dependencies to 2 different targets results in a duplicate detected error.
