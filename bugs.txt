List of bugs:
---------------
1. Adding a module which already exists in the project.yaml but had its folder subsequently removed will be added twice 
	to the project.yaml when the appropriate --create flag is passed.

List of annoyances:
-------------------
1. The 'spawned directories' message seems too verbose for high-level use. Should probably be kept for the spawn command.
2. When adding an existing module before the project is initialized, the default module1 is added and spawned despite the
	user clearly providing a module to use instead of the default module1.
* It may be best to consider not needing to add module1 to the project by default.
3. Compared to git, bulgogi seems to be pretty verbose.
