- Running `bul tree` will sometimes tree and print from a non-module target directory (won't ever exist).

- The `./CMakeLists.txt` add_library() trick for target-libraries without resident modules will only work if its dependencies are 
        declared by the time it tries to be linked.
=> So link after all of the submodules are added?

- Running `bul gen --create` leads to the following exception being throw:
        libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type std::__1::__fs::filesystem::filesystem_error: filesystem error: in create_directories: No such file or directory [""]
- The project was configured like so:
default:
  - module1
  - module2
  - module3
  - target1
target1:
  - module3
  - module4

  - And modules for each directory were present
