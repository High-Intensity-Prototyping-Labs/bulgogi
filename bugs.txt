default:
  - module1*
  - module2
target1:
  - module3
  - module4
  - module32
target2:
  - module3
  - module5*
  - target1

When the project is configured like this (and there is a module32 directory in the project root), running
```bul module rm module32 --all```
does **not** delete the module32 attachment from the target1 NOR does it remove it from the filesystem.

It seems like the associated remove-all-deps/remove-from-filesystem relationship was respected, but something obviously went wrong.
