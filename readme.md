# bulgogi
InDev v1.0.0

## Overview
Bulgogi is a C/C++ build-system orchestrator for CubeSats.

## Synopsis
See [synopsis.txt](./synopsis.txt)

## Motivation
The explosion in the embedded development industry has largely been to the benefit of mega-coporations with the resources and capacity to mass produce hardware or hire specialists to develop software and platform solutions.

This is not an inherent wrong -- but aside from a few community-driven efforts such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, few turn-key solutions exist for embedded development at a grassroots level which make the boilerplate nuts and bolts intuitive to use and re-apply as necessary.

This includes:
- Build system configuration (CMake, Bazel),
- Cross-compilation toolchain installs and integration,
- Dependency mangement and linkage,

As the hardware has become cheap and abundant, the skills, methods and know-how have not.

There will be no embedded revolution or pervasive computing era in the truest sense if aspiring embedded engineers and hobbyists cannot quickly and effectively deploy small to medium-scale projects at low-to-no cost.
