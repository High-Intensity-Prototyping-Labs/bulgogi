For each entry in the YAML:
        -> Does the name already exist in the target list?
                -> Update it to be a library target

        -> Does the name correspond to a directory in the context dir?
                -> (?) Add it as a directory target (must be prepended with context dir ALWAYS)
                -> Change the context dir 

        -> Does the name correspond to a file in the context dir?
                -> (?) Add it as a file target 

        -> Neither
                -> Add it as an executable target

Terminal types:
- BUL_EXE
- BUL_LIB
- BUL_FILE

Propagating types:
- BUL_DIR

Updating an existing target:
        -> Is the target a BUL_DIR?
                -> For each dep: update target 
        -> Is the target anything else?
